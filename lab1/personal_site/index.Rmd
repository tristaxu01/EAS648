# Hello!

Welcome to my personal site. This homepage is written in **R Markdown** and will be published on **GitHub Pages**.

- I am a 2nd year Data Science Master student at Umich
- I am interested in: _data science, cognitive science, and sustainability_.
- This site will grow as I add more `.Rmd` analyses under **Analyses**.

## A photo of me (replace with your own)

Place your images in the `img/` folder and reference them like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='300px'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/profile.JPG')
```
